# About

I'm a master student & developer based in Nagoya, currently working on my master's degree in a [コクリツ大学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_universities_in_Japan). I love elegent designs & products which are both artistic and practical.

Learned to play guiter from high school and builded a pop music band called 'Moment' as a bassist. Got a BSc degree in Computer Science from CUMT, and spent 3 years studying abroad in Japan. I have been contributing to [open source](https://github.com/Kiotlin) since 2016, being used to build things with JavaScript & Python. 
Some memorable works:

 - A polaroid photo generator using DALL-E called [dalle-polaroid](https://github.com/Kiotlin/dalle-polaroid).
 - [Workshop.guide](https://workshop-guide.vercel.app/) which records tools in my common usage.
 - Builded a rss subscriber for Final Fantasy XIV Chinese server on [RSSHub](https://docs.rsshub.app/game.html#zui-zhong-huan-xiang-14).
 - A NS style timezone converter called [conv-ti](https://kiotlin.github.io/conv-ti/).

Dreaming of becoming a freelancer developer and publishing my original album. Now keep reading.
