# About

I'm a master student & developer based in Nagoya, currently working on my master's degree in a [コクリツ大学](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_national_universities_in_Japan). I love elegent designs & products which are both artistic and practical.

Learned to play guiter from high school and builded a pop music band called 'Moment' as a bassist. Got a BSc degree in Computer Science from CUMT, and spent 3 years studying abroad in Japan. I have been contributing to [open source](https://github.com/Kiotlin) since 2016, being used to build things with JavaScript & Python. 
Some memorable works:

 - A polaroid photo generator using DALL-E called [dalle-polaroid](https://dalle-polaroid-website.vercel.app/).
 - [Workshop.guide](https://kitbook.iken.moe/) which records tools in my common usage.
 - Builded several rss feeds based on RSSHub for [Final Fantasy XIV (CN)](https://docs.rsshub.app/game.html#zui-zhong-huan-xiang-14), [LiSA Official](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/live.html#lisa).
 - A NS style timezone converter called [conv-ti](https://kiotlin.github.io/conv-ti/).

Dreaming of becoming a freelancer developer and publishing my original album or product. Now keep reading.
